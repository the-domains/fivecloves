Now + Then + Tomorrow

Staring points are at end a parallel of skies that peaks into many windows of opportunities.

We decided years ago to change the world for the good and make better a place where all will strive.

Then we turned to each other and asked the question of whats the next step?

Afterwards, took a deep look into tomorrow... The future of our actions imperative decisions.

Responisable, detertmine, and forwardness in the overall big picturue of pholosiphics and social impact of overall.

How so can it be that where we have came is now dictating where we are going...

Future is tomorrow not today,nor now,
