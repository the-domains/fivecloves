  I met with two friends in April 2014 to discuss coworking. Existing offices
  were then not well funded, expensive nor nice-enough. Three were planned. One
  for her only so she could do her best work without distraction in a safe
  space. Another was to be for the genders and our prized flagship. Last, was
  for students. We wanted to remove parents income from what students can
  achieve in school. The rising trend was an opportunity to be a company built
  by the finest team that friendship can muster. Join by one of the best
  Architect in Singapore. Its about stretching money, time and resources. This
  company would balance work and play.
